/* THe object-oriented concept of encapsulation provides a mechansim for mimiting access
 * to memebers of an object. 
 * In C++ this is implemented using the following access contraol keywords for classes and
 * structs 
 * Public : Members are accessible outside of the class/struct. This is the default access level for 
 * structs.
 *
 * Protected : Members are accessible within the specific class and any defived clases only
 * Private: Members are accesible only within the speicific class they are defiened within
 * Package-private in Java means that a member can be accessed only by classes within the same package. This is the default visibility in Java. Package-private is a great way to allow other classes in a JAR file to access internal members without exposing them globally to your clients. For example, itâ€™s particularly useful for unit tests that need to verify the behavior of private methods.
C++ does not have the concept of package-private visibility. Instead, it uses the more permissive notion of friendship to allow named classes and functions to access protected and private members of a class. Friendship can be used to enhance encapsulation, but it can also overexpose internal details to your clients if used carelessly.*/


/* Encapsulation is the proces of seperating the public interface of an API from its underlying
 * implementation 
 * Logical hiding means using the C++ language features of protected and private to restrict
 * access to internal detaisl . 
 *
 *
 * Hide Member variables :
 *  The term encapsulation is also often used to describe the bundling of data with the methods that 
 *  operate on those data. This is implemented in C++ by having classes that can contain both variables
 *  and methods. However, in terms of Good API design, you should never make member variables
 *  public. If data members form part of the logical interface of the API, the you should instread
 *  provide getter and/or setter methods, that provide indirect access to the member variables
 *  avoid writing
