C++ can take a while to compile 

Main load is on CPU

Scales nicely 

There are also a few tricks to make compilation faster


But why is the compilation slow ?
    There might be many reasons 
    The first reason is wrong build settings 

    Bad code structure might be an issue 

    Unnecessary #includes

    Complex code

    Templates 

    Inline Code 

There are many reasons but there are reasons to spped up compilation 


Configuring Build Tools 

Compilation parallelizes Well


Use as many cores as you can 


For really large projects, use distributed compilation: IncrediBuild, 
distcc, and FASTBuild

Compiler optimizations affect performance


Consider creating a build configuration 


Turn them off in development:
    This also simplifies debugging

Precompiled Headers

A headef file that is compiled before everything else in the project and #inluded in all CPP files:

    Compiler does not have to parse that code again 
    User #inlucde comomon libraries, such as STL

Check your IDE and Compiler Docs for Precompiled Headers
Precompiled Headers imporve speed 

Compiler-Friendly Code

#include the necessary minimum -> 
always use include guards  #ifndef DAYTIME_CLIENT_H
                           #define DAYTIME_CLIENT_H

Forward-declare types as much as possible 
                //forward declartions
                namespace boost::asio
                {
                    class io_context;
                }


Reduce dependencies 


Don't inline code unless absolutely-necessary

When creating class templates, keep non-template code elsewhere

Use the pimpl Idiom
