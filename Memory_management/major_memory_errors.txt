1) Memory Leaks
    Forgetting delete/Free
    Exception safety 

2) If you are managing the memory yourself 
    Delete allocated objects

2. Mismatched allocation and dellocation 

Allocation and deallocation comes in pairs


* Allocation         Deallocation 

* malloc =-------> Free ( heap)

* new   =--------> delete (Free store)

* new[] =--------> delete[] ( Array of objects on free store)



3) Invalid Pointer

Pointer to 
    Deleted memory (dangling pointer)
    Local Variable

Not Initialized Yet



4) Buffer Overrun 

    *Array bounds violation 
    * Writing past end of array

    * Security Flaws

5)
