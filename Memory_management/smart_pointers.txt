Smart pointers in standard C++

* std::unique_ptr
    * One and only one pointer to free store
    * Strong ownership

* std::shared_ptr

    * Many pointers to free store
    * Shared ownership


* std::weak_ptr

    * "Refrence" to shared_ptr
    * No ownership



The weak pointer is a weak handle to the shared pointer 


Smart Pointers 

Introduced with C++11
Resoves many problems with memoryleaks

Can  Tramsfer or share ownership without leaks



Deprecates old std::auto_ptr

Sometimes had unexpected behavior
Replace these with std::unique_ptr


Must always be put on the stack rather than on a heap
