# COMMON C++ CONVENTIONS AND DESIGN PATTERNS 
** These are important statements derived directly from the book [Effective C++] (https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Specific-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing-ebook/dp/B004V4420U/ref=sr_1_2?crid=B7OBYHH2NS3F&keywords=effective+c%2B%2B&qid=1651293361&sprefix=effective+c%2B%2B%2Caps%2C541&sr=8-2).

** The easiest way to view C++ not as a single language but a federation of related languages.**

** To make sense of C++ you have to recognize its primary sub languages. There are four of them . **


## C. 
** Deep down C++ is still based on C. blocks, statements, preprocessor, built-in datatypes, arrays, pointers etc.
all come from C but when you find yourself working with the C part of C++. the rules for effective programming 
reflect C's more limited scope. no templates, no exceptions, no overloading. etc. ** 


## Object-Oriented C++ .
** This part of C++ is what C with Classes was all about: classes (including constructors and destructors) encapsulation
inheritence polymorphism. virtual functions(dynamic binding), etc. This is the part of C++ to which the class rules 
for object-oriented mostly directly apply. ** 


## Template C++.
